Java Websocket chat POC
===================================


## Introduction

This project is a real-time and highly scalable chat solution which is using Play Framework-java and others.

Thanks to Play Framework, it built on Akka, and using a not-bocking IO, which facilitates the communication for Real-time purposes. Since Play Framework is using Java, you will need the JVM, furthermore JRE for development.

It is absolutely following the principles of SOA, therefore there is an complete ubound between client and server. This offers the flexibility to use the services from other clients behind the web, if desired.

You can use the system as:
- Invitado, this is the guest mode
- Usuario, this is the authentified mode- you will see your name in the room user's list

Channels-chat releases two channels to chat.

- Canal1 , it is a name of a channel, which will not let you to publish until you are sucesfully authentified
- Canal2, you can subscribe and publish in this channel without restrictions


## Installation

You must be in a linux machine with apt-get packet management system. 
I assume:
- You have set-up your permisions for the system/folder you are working in
- You have a JDK 1.8-or later- installed
- Activator sucessfully installed

Setup the socketcluster command:
```bash
activator app-name play-java
```


Now, just get the code
```bash
git clone git@github.com:franjoespejo/play-chat.git
```

It's all

## Use

Once in the folder: 

```bash
activator run
```

### Access at URL http://localhost:9000/
You will see a nice web.
In the top there is a selector for switching between Channels.
